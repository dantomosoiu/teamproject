\begin_layout Section*
GUI Design and Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The target userbase for the evacuator does not guarantee a good degree of
 computer-literacy.
 Hence a clear and easy to use GUI was required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Initial Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based from initial system requirements a wireframe for the GUI could be
 generated.
 To keep the user experience simple it was decided to keep all the basic
 functionality within the main window.
 This allows unfamiliar users to gain from the software without being overwhelme
d by endless options.
 For advanced configuration there was to be a detailed configuration panel
 allowing advanced users to set the majority of variables as they saw fit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wireframe below was drawn up to support these concepts.
 By sticking to conventions it gives a familiar feel to most who have used
 a typical windows based system within the last decade.

\begin_layout Subsection*
GUI Implementation and Revision
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was decided since the project was to be built in java and several members
 had knowledge of the library to use Swing for implementation of the GUI.
 The toolkit was more than capable of our needs and any advantages of alternativ
es seemed unlikely to counterbalance the time required to learn a new environmen
t.
 SWT was briefly considered since the interface created generally allows
 a closer to native feel and higher performance (http://www.ibm.com/developerworks
/grid/library/os-swingswt/).
 This however would come at a cost of portability as well as the time considerat
ion mentioned above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GUI implementation was a quick and crude attempt towards the initial
 wireframe.
 Its purpose was more towards checking how well the JMonkey canvas could
 be displayed within the Swing layout than producing a suitable end product.

\begin_layout Standard
Whilst not particurly attractive a suitable platform for basic testing was
 then available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point it became apparent that the back end would not easily allow
 for the evacuation to be

scrolled through

\end_inset

 in the way we had initially anticipated.
 The play bar at the bottom of the screen was removed from designs.
 this Led to the control buttons being moved to the panel on the right.
 After speaking to some less computer-literate users it was further decided
 to use a traditional menu-bar.
 Some also found the nav-mesh didn't give an immediate understanding of
 what the model represented so toggles were added to allow a physical representa
tion of the ship to be shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These changes manifested themselves as can be seen below.
 Due to more time being spent on this iteration it gives a much more complete
 feel and is considerably closed to the initial wireframe.

\begin_layout Standard
Further talks with users suggested that for those not used to computer-games
 the keyboard based camera controls were not immediately understandable
 so a control panel was added.
 Due to the way functionality was implemented a route button was added for
 testing purposes.
 It was then decided this would be of use to users so was left in.
 Finally, to allow a more native feel the theming was set to inherit from
 the system the code was run from.
 A new wireframe (below) was drawn up as below to show this.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Final GUI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wireframe above was implmented to give our final GUI.
 It gives a polished finish and meets original aims well and takes into
 consideration user feedback.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initial work was done using the Netbeans GUI builder.
 This allowed the layout we required to be built quickly, but not the functional
ity.
