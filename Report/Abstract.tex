This project is concerned with the development of an evacuation simulator for the Tall Ship at Riverside, Glasgow. Such a system may be used in place of mock evacuations. As well as saving the resources needed to run such evacuations, this gives the user control over environmental and population variables, allowing them to experiment with a large number of alternate scenarios at their own convenience.\\
Many such systems have been developed using varying approaches. The aims of this project reflect a desire to use the best of these approaches along with modern software frameworks to create a flexible and extensible system.\\
Most of the project's aims and requirements were satisfied. However, various difficulties were encountered in the late stages of the development life-cycle which ultimately led to a reduction of the system's scope.
