The following is a summary of the requirements the team feels have been achieved. Testing the initial requirements proved challenging because most of the client's requests were non-functional requirements or complex to test (e.g. the requirement of having a usable GUI). Unfortunately an acceptance test demonstration could not be carried out with the client at the time of writing.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{All of the system's `Must Have' requirements}
\item{Ability to set different categories of agent}
\item{Ability for the user to specify environmental and population variables}
\item{Pseudo-random population generation including randomising initial parameters as well as positions}
\item{Accurate timescale}
\item{Allow the user to change the perspective (camera location and visual representation)}
\end{enumerate}

The extent to which we have achieved an effective GUI is discussed separately in the User Evaluation Section \ref{results}.
