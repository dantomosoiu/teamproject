\begin{abstract}
It is acknowledged that the cost of 
running evacuation drills in public environments is relatively high both in time and money. This is because very often, the 
evacuation drills have to be run at night where the chosen environment is not in service and consequently additional payments for 
equipment, hiring evacuees and fire consultants are needed.
There are also some types of evacuation that cannot be drilled both safely and accurately such as a large fire.
An evacuation simulator is a possible solution to these problems which uses human behaviour in an evacuation environment 
to predict the egress of a population. This project involves producing a three-dimensional visualised 
evacuation simulator of The Tall Ship at Riverside, Glasgow. Psychology of mass emergency evacuation behaviour and crowd patterns are applied in 
order to best determine how people will react in an evacuation situation. Furthermore, several pathfinding algorithms 
are studied to ascertain their relative suitability for the project.
The implementation side of this project 
involves the modelling of the chosen environment in 3D visualisation and simulating an evacuation on this model.
By combining these, the evacuation simulator can be more realistic.

Here we explain that Lewis Carroll wrote chapter \ref{intro}. John Wayne
was out riding his horse every day and didn't do anything. Marilyn Monroe
was great at getting the requirements specification and coordinating the
writing of the report. Betty Davis did the coding of the kernel of the
project, described in Chapter \ref{impl}.  James Dean handled the
multimedia content of the project.
