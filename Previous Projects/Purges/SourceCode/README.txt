This folder contains all the source code files for Purges. There are some convenience windows 'bat' files supplied to make compilation and running easier on that platform.

I will not go into how to compile the program as this is too long a subject. I will assume that if you want to compile the source code then you are already familiar with Java and know what you are doing.

You can find a runnable version of the program in the Executable folder on this CD.


n.b.,
There is a 'de' folder in this dierectory. This is a loader package used in Purges but was not written by the Purges programmer. This is a loader that was kindly supplied by Johannes Raida. More information about the loader can be found at http://www.johannes-raida.de

Parts of the image files in this folder were kindly supplied by Strathclyde Public Transport and the University of Glasgow.
