Purges Change Log:

This document documents the various features and changes in each version of Purges: The Public Underground Railway General Evacuation Simulator.

The current version of Purges is version 0.11.


Version 0.11
------------
* Fixed the sporadic 'walk through walls bug' by calling a reset graph function before each a* search. This also makes other movement less irratic (finally convinced a* is fully working now).
* Block areas window now removed when loading a new file to stop orphaned windows.
* Cleaned up the code
* Rotation slider is now reset when a new file is loaded (fixes the initial 'jump' effect)


Version 0.10
------------
* File Loader splash screen is no longer time sensitive (removed when file is loaded or when user clicks window)
* Changed engine to re-assign a random goal if current goal is unreachable
* Blocking function menu option now only enabled if blocking areas found in file.
* Blocking window now remembers state of checkboxes.
* Population entry now disabled during simulation run (since changing has no effect anyway)


Version 0.09
------------
* Added a blocking function to GUI (though people don't know to find a new goal yet)
* Added a clock to show elapsed time in simulation
* Added a slider for environment manipulation to replace the old mouse rotate system.
* Added a pause/resume option
* Changed default population from file to now represent maximum population for environment.
* Population size now decreases as people exit the environment (and it reset at end of simulation).


Version 0.08
------------
* Added an 'about' option to GUI
* Added a Quick Help option to GUI
* Added a change Simulation Speed option to GUI


Version 0.07
------------
* Added a basic GUI (simple open file and run simulation/change population size)
* Added a 'loading file' splash screen


Version 0.06
------------
* Added a splash screen


Version 0.05
------------
* Camera position now handled by Purges instead if Java3D default.
* Camera position now comes from file format


Version 0.04
------------
* Fixed the major bugs in the program (the flying effect)
* Shifted all dependent values into file format. Engine is now completely file independent
* Goals are now assigned based on vicinity and Monte Carlo. This produces reasonably realistic decisions and usually prevents the 'stupid' blockage effect (not using an exit right behind you).


Version 0.03
------------
* Formalised Monte Carlo added to determine which goal people choose
* Formalised Monte Carlo used to determine each person's aggressiveness


Version 0.02
------------
* Multiple goals now supported
* Goals now come from file format
* Movement improved by making special vertices that cannot be blocked (such as goal vertices)


Version 0.01
------------
* Multiple animated people
* A single goal to be reached
* File format for interchangeable environments
* Removal of people when goal is reached
